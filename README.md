# 🌍 Geo Tracking of Waste: Revolutionizing Urban Cleanliness

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Urban areas face major challenges in **efficient waste management** due to difficulties in identifying and prioritizing waste hotspots. Traditional methods are **resource-intensive and inefficient**, leading to unsanitary conditions and public health risks.

## 💡 Solution: Geo Tracking of Waste
Our solution leverages **real-time video analysis and geo-tracking** to detect and map waste accumulation across cities. By mounting **cameras on government or public vehicles**, we can capture, analyze, and geotag waste hotspots, ensuring **efficient cleanup operations**.

## 🏆 Waste Index Definition
The **Waste Index** is a numerical measure representing the **waste density** of a particular area. It is calculated based on:
✅ **Frequency** of detected waste instances.
✅ **Volume & type** of waste identified.
✅ **Duration** of waste accumulation before cleanup.
✅ **Historical trends** of waste presence in a region.

This index allows municipalities to **prioritize high-waste areas** for **efficient resource allocation and strategic waste management**.

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ **Real-Time Waste Identification:** AI-powered detection of waste hotspots through vehicle-mounted cameras.
✅ **Geo-Location Tagging:** Captured images and videos include precise geographical coordinates.
✅ **High Waste Area Mapping:** Visualization of waste-dense regions using real-time data.
✅ **Advanced Image Processing:** Neural network-based detection ensures high accuracy and efficiency.
✅ **Cost-Effective Hardware:** **Arduino-based solutions** for geo-tracking, enabling offline data storage and synchronization.
